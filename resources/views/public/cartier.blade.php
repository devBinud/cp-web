                                    <p class="cartier_p">Cartier is a one-stop solution for all your training needs. It's a
                                        cloud-based
                                        software that allows a company to easily digitize and quickly upload the existing
                                        records via bulk upload. All of the training information that is needed will be in
                                        one source and can be accessed from anywhere. It automates the procedures that would
                                        otherwise take a very long time, such as determining who needs what training, when
                                        they completed it, and when it expires. One can create detailed customized reports
                                        using reporting functions to gain insight into their company's training. Although a
                                        designated person will be required to monitor the company's training, Cartier
                                        enables everyone to share the responsibility by enabling everyone to upload the
                                        records, get expiry notices immediately, and complete auto-assigned training on
                                        time.</p>
                                    <p class="cartier_p">Maintaining training records in the workplace is necessary for a
                                        company's smooth
                                        operation. Whether itâ€™s a small or multinational company, they must remain on top of
                                        training needs and ensure that all legal obligations are satisfied. Digitizing the
                                        data reduces the amount of physical space required and saves time invested filing
                                        and locating documents. This procedure can be automated to guarantee that expiration
                                        dates are not missed and that relevant employee training is assigned. Reporting
                                        functions enable to detect any gaps or expenditures that may be addressed by an
                                        authorized employee. Cartier, which is a cloud based training record management
                                        system, simplifies the process by combining all of these critical aspects into one
                                        online system as maintaining training records of a company digitally is very
                                        essential for running a safe and productive workplace.</p>

                                    <p class="cartier_p">The client wanted a detailed report feature to be added against
                                        each employee with a

                                    <p class="cartier_p">As our software was advanced, we had to make it in a simple version
                                        without any
                                        change in the features as per the requirements of the client.</p>
                                    <p class="cartier_p">We had to make an inbuilt format sheet for the clients to download
                                        and then upload in
                                        bulk as even a little change of letter may lead to rejection or non detection by the

                                    <p class="cartier_p">The client wanted to add a feature where they can know about the
                                        skills and knowledge
                                        gained by the employees due to which we had to add an extra section where they can
                                        give an exam on the training they attended and get their report&nbsp;</p>

                                            authorized employees of
                                            the company from anywhere.</li>
                                        <li class="cartier_p">Simplifies the process by combining all of these critical

                                            and saves administrative time on filing and locating documents.</li>
                                        <li class="cartier_p">Saves a lot of time as It automates the processes that are
                                            ordinarily very
                                            time-consuming.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li class="cartier_p">It allows users to digitize the existing records quickly via

                                            same time.</li>
                                        <li class="cartier_p">Data can be stored for a longer duration without the risk of
