                    </div>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">Nowadays, a high-quality web product is synonymous with a successful
                        business. As a result, one of the most important steps before launching a website is website QA
                        testing. Entrusting this work to our QA-engineers will increase business productivity and give you
                        more time to work on other projects. And you know what's even better? Our quality assurance services
                        are affordable.
                    </p>

                    <p class="color_p_secondary">At Codepilot Technologies, we oversee the entire quality assurance process
                        in the following manner:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a QA strategy and test plan.</li>
                        <li>Estimating the project's relevance for test automation and calculating its ROI</li>
                        <li>Including and carrying out all relevant testing activities in the SDLC.</li>
                        <li>Providing regular test reports and performance reports on the QA team.
                        </li>
                        <li>Managing and improving the testing team's performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">As part of a one-time or continuous testing engagement, we provide manual
                        and automated testing activities that include such testing types as:
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="color_primary">Functional Testing :</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">Functional Testing ensures website quality assurance that considers
                        previously specified software behaviour based on system specifications. Its most significant
                        advantage is the simulation of actual website applications. Internal programme structure is rarely
                        considered when testing functions by feeding them input and examining the output. Typically,
                        functional testing describes what the system does.

                    </p>
                    <h5 class="color_primary">Maintenance Testing:</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">The type of testing performed on software during an enhancement, change, or
                        migration cycle to other hardware is determined by the testing results. It is necessary to test
                        previously deployed software. There are two types of maintenance testing:

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="text-danger">Confirmation testing : </span>Confirmation testing is done to ensure
                            that previously discovered bugs and errors are fixed. The experts at Codepilot Technologies will
                            assist you in identifying potential bugs and errors on your site in order to avoid significant
                            losses.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="text-danger">Regression testing: </span>Regression testing is the umbrella term for
                            all types of testing designed to detect errors in previously tested code snippets. This type of
                            testing ensures that previously developed and tested software continues to function correctly
                            after changes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="color_primary">Performance Evaluation:</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">It is one of the most important steps in website quality control testing
                        because it shows how a website will respond to a load with a specific number of visitors. The use of
                        this test site enhancement prevents site overload and ensures continuous work during peak loads.

                    <h5 class="color_primary">Testing for Usability:</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary"> The purpose of this testing is to demonstrate how easy the user interface
                        is to use. It determines whether or not the application or product developed is user-friendly. It is
                        classified into two types:

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="text-danger">User interface testing : </span>During this step, the product is
                            checked for compliance with the requirements of user usability. The primary goal is to assess
                            the interface's usability, including navigation effectiveness and user information perception.
                            After analyzing user feedback, engineers refine details.

                        </li>
                        <li><span class="text-danger">Cross-platform testing: </span> A type of specialised testing that
                            determines if a product can be used on multiple platforms by determining its behavior in various
                            environments. The platform can be used to include various operating systems and devices that
                            will be required to run your solution. Cross-platform testing encompasses cross-device testing
                            as well.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="color_primary">Quality Assurance and Code Review:</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">A systematic software source-code review detects and corrects errors that
                        went undetected during development. The primary goal of this review is to improve software quality.

                    <h5 class="color_primary">
                        Compatibility Testing
                        :</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">This type of software testing is used to ensure product compatibility with
                        various other objects such as web browsers, platforms, users (in cases of very specific requirement
                        types, such as user who speaks and reads in only one language), Oss, and so on. The purpose of this
                        type of testing is to determine how the system performs in a specific environment, which includes
                        the hardware, network, operating system, and other software.

                    <h5 class="color_primary">
                        Website Security Testing
                        :</h5>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">Software security testing measures how vulnerable it is to different types
                        of attacks. In many cases, computer systems are used as targets for trespassing or illegal
                        penetration. The term 'trespassing' can refer to a variety of activities, from casual hacking to
                        more nefarious hacking by rogues looking to gain illegal profit.

                    <p class="color_p_secondary fw-bold text-uppercase text-danger">Our approach has always been based on
                        the idea that a more collaborative and transparent process leads to more efficient and successful
                        outcomes.

                    <h5 class="color_primary">
                        Our goal at Codepilot Technologies is to help eliminate QA process constraints, achieve a higher
                        level of QA maturity by
                        :</h5>
