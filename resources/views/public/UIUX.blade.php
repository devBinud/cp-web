                    </div>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary">We have all heard conversations on the streets of tech capitals about a
                        great 'UX' for a product or a poor 'UI' for a website. Is it a secret language you'll never learn?
                        Interested in learning how UX and UI differ? You've come to the right place.

                        UI/UX can help you acquire more customers. In simple terms, it is about attracting new customers and
                        providing them with a great user experience. The reason for this is that your users will find it
                        easier to interact with your website and navigate through it more easily.

                    </p>

                    <h5 class="color_primary">UX and UI: How They Work Together</h5>

                    <p class="color_p_secondary">For most small business owners, their website is a digital portfolio that
                        tells more about their company, their values and beliefs, and their products or services.
                        But did you know that the design of a website influences up to 75% of people's perception of its
                        credibility? That is why it is critical to have a basic understanding of UX and UI design so you can
                        understand how they work together to ensure your website is driving your business goals. UX is an
                        abbreviation for User Experience, which is a branch of web design that uses critical analysis and
                        logic to understand and plan for a user's interaction with products, systems, and services.
                        Usability, design, navigation, and impression are all part of it. Simply put, it is about creating
                        an outstanding web design.
                    </p>

                    <p class="color_p_secondary">UI stands for User Interface, and it refers to all of the points of contact
                        between a user and a computer programme, in this case, your website. The interface is a collection
                        of commands or menus that allow the user to interact with the programme. The ease and intuitiveness
                        with which a person can do what they need to do on your site is determined by UI design. UI design
                        is similar to the furnishings, paint, and small details that create the mood of a home.

                    </p>

                    <p class="color_p_secondary">Both UX and UI are cohesive design disciplines with similar goals that pave
                        the way for a fantastic end product. It would not be incorrect to say that UX and UI are
                        complementary aspects of web design, with one being insufficient without the other.

                    </p>

                    <p class="color_p_secondary">When it comes to their distinctions, it is critical to project these
                        disciplines as distinct organisational roles. While UX is more of a data-driven projection of how
                        the customer should feel while on your website, UI considers design patterns and even the smallest
                        of details.

                    </p>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary"> Furthermore, UI design is concerned with making the layout delightful and
                        enjoyable, whereas UX design is concerned with ease of use. UX is more of a feeling or concept that
                        promises smoothness, responsiveness, and the overall premise of the website. UI, on the other hand,
                        includes elements, tools, technical tidbits, and digital interfaces that are directly related to the
                        design process.

                    </p>
                    <p class="color_p_secondary"> It is critical to conduct extensive research for the product you wish to
                        create. Here at Codepilot Technologies, we assist in this by defining the user audience, developing
                        user stories, conducting competitive analysis, and much more.

                        If you are unsure about how your app behaves, we can assist you by performing a thorough UX audit
                        that will highlight the majority of the issues in your product.
                        From there, we can take it a step further and resolve all issues by developing a platform with an
                        easy-to-use user interface.

                        If you don’t know what kind of service to request from us, don’t worry we know what users look for
                        in an app.We can help and see what fits your business and your budget.
